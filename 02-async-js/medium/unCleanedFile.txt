Web   Workers   are   a      simple  means    for    web content to   run scripts   in background     threads. 
The     worker   thread      can       perform      tasks without       interfering        with the user interface. In addition, they can perform I/O using XMLHttpRequest (although the responseXML      and channel attributes are always null) or fetch      (with no such restrictions). 
Once          created, a worker can send messages to the          JavaScript code       that          created it by posting          messages to an               event handler specified by that code (and vice versa).
